## About
Java FX My Todo app is a Java based application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
## Context
This full-stack project includes a firebase backend and a Java Front End. This application was created for desktop computers. Additionally, users can easily manage task lists.

## Challenges

Because I was unfamiliar with firebase and had no prior experience performing NoSQL operations on firebase, this project presented challenges. However, I discovered that NoSQL is best suited for simple applications that do not require atomic transactions or schema-less tables. I completed this project in one week despite having only one month of Java experience.
