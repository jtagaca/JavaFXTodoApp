## About
Java FX My Todo app is a java based application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks.
## Context

This full-stack project features a PHP backend and a Java front end. In addition, Google Cloud hosts Firebase NoSQL for data persistence. This application has been designed for desktop computers. And allows users to manage task lists with ease.

## Challenges

This project presented obstacles because I was unfamiliar with firebase and had no prior experience performing NoSQL operations on firebase. I discovered, however, that NoSQL is ideal for simple applications that don't require atomic transactions and schema-less tables. Despite having only one month of Java experience, I completed this project in one week.
